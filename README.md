# Simple Interactive Web Calculator

A minimalist, fully functional web-based calculator designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. This project demonstrates fundamental front-end web development skills using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive functionality.

## Features

-   **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
-   **Decimal Support:** Allows calculations with floating-point numbers.
-   **Clear Function:** An "AC" (All Clear) button to reset the display and current calculation.
-   **Responsive Design:** Adapts reasonably well to different screen sizes due to CSS Grid. (You can add this if you feel it looks good on mobile and tablet)
-   **Intuitive User Interface:** Mimics the layout of a standard calculator keypad for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** For the basic structure and layout of the calculator.
-   **CSS3:** For styling the calculator's appearance, including layout with CSS Grid, button styles, and responsiveness.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For handling user interactions, managing calculator state, and performing calculations.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/michaelp91-dev/simple-js-calculator.git
    cd simple-js-calculator
    ```

2.  **Open in Browser:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or by using a live server extension if you're using a desktop environment (or Acode's built-in preview).

## Live Demo

## Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas)

-   Add keyboard support for input.
-   Implement more advanced scientific functions (e.g., square root, percentage, trigonometry).
-   Include an operation history display.
-   Improve error handling for invalid inputs.
